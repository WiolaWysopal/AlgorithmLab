# AlgorithmLab — React + Node.js

The project demonstrates the operation of selected algorithms through interactive visualization.
Its goal is to showcase practical knowledge of algorithms and the ability to implement them in a full-stack application.

## 🛠 Technologies

- **Frontend:** React + Vite
  - `React` — a library for building user interfaces
  - `Vite` — a fast bundler and development server for frontend projects

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
  - `Node.js` — a JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development
  - `Express` — a framework for building APIs and handling HTTP requests
  - `CORS` — middleware that allows communication between frontend and backend running on different ports
